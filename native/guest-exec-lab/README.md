# Guest Runtime Fixtures

Opt-in development tools and reference fixtures for
[`native/guest-runtime`](../guest-runtime/README.md). Runtime sources live only in
that native component; this directory is not packaged into the APK.

`prepare.mjs` authenticates Debian archive metadata and packages, then extracts
an isolated test rootfs without maintainer scripts or host installation.
`build.sh` builds the same CMake runtime as the APK and separate Bionic/glibc
fixtures. It requires the Termux development toolchain; installed guest launches
do not require Termux. Exact inputs are retained in the build's `manifest.json`.

```sh
node native/guest-exec-lab/prepare.mjs build/guest-fixtures --gtk
sh native/guest-exec-lab/build.sh build/guest-fixtures
python native/guest-exec-lab/test_device.py build/guest-fixtures --packages
python native/guest-exec-lab/test_graphics.py build/guest-fixtures
python native/guest-exec-lab/test_graphics.py build/guest-fixtures --gtk
```

Device checks use the configured MagicDesk MCP connection and require selected
shell UID 2000. They do not change identity, install an APK or start Desktop.
Graphical checks use a private virtual display and clean up their own sessions.
Results retain exact device/build identities, commands, failures and known limits.
Prepared shell-owned test stores remain at the recorded path for inspection.

Capability fault injection checks that missing kernel calls reject only guest
execution. Process fixtures cover concurrent distinct stores, cancellation and
orphan ownership. These checks do not emulate an old kernel or prove compatibility
with every distribution. See the native component's coverage and limits.
